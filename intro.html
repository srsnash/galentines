                <p>to my beautiful souls,</p>
                <p>there are few things in this world as magical as the kind of love we share. it’s the kind of love that feels like a deep breath after a long day, like soft morning light spilling through the window, like laughter that echoes long after it’s faded.</p>
                <p>you are my sisters in spirit, my soul’s companions, my mirrors and my muses. with you, love is effortless, flowing like a river, endless and free. our laughter is poetry, our memories are constellations, and every moment together feels like a little piece of eternity.</p>
                <p>there is something sacred in the way we hold each other: through joy, through heartache, through the in-betweens. you remind me, time and time again, that love is not just something we give, but something we ARE.</p>
                <p>so here’s to us!! to our wild dreams, to our endless conversations, to the way our hearts speak a language only we understand. may we always find each other, in every lifetime, in every universe, in every little moment where love decides to bloom.</p>
                <p>with all the softness, love, light, and warmth of my heart,</p>
                <p><strong>aishwarya ⋆˚𝜗𝜚˚⋆</strong></p>
